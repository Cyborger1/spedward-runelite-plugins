# Profiles Panel

The profiles panel allows you to store your usernames/login emails and enter them into the login screen with a single click.

Each login you store can be given an alias to make it easy to associate with an account.

Enabling streamer mode hides the logins on the profiles panel, showing only the alias for each account.

Password support requires you use an encryption key that is not saved anywhere. You do not require entering a password to use this plugin and all passwords are encrypted before being saved.

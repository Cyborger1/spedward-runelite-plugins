# Group Iron Man
Adds the capability to play Group Iron Man

Players in your group must be added to the plugin config, one player per line.

What this plugin does:

1. Removes trade ability with players not within the player's group
2. Removes the ability to use the Grand Exchange
3. Removes the ability to duel players not within the player's group
4. Removes the ability to buy anything but the Scroll of redirection at the NMZ store
5. Removes the ability to receive items through the Falador Party Room

There is an added option to play as an Ultimate Group Iron Man with the added restrictions:

1. Cannot use Banks or Deposit boxes
2. Cannot use Seed Vault
3. Cannot create item sets
4. Cannot receive resources from Managing Miscellania
5. Cannot collect sand from Bert

What this plugin cannot do:

1. Block experience gain from PVP
2. Disable Accept Aid
3. Disable Protect Item for Ultimates
4. Prevent purchasing of overstocked items in stores (will add by popular demand)
5. Prevent entering player owned houses of players not within your group (not entirely sure it's possible)
6. Prevent sending servants to bank or sawmill for Ultimates (I cannot test this)

# Spedward's Profiles Panel
The profiles panel allows you to store your usernames/log in emails and enter them into the log in screen with a single click.

Each log in you store can be given an alias to make it easy to associate with an account.

Enabling streamer mode hides the log ins on the profiles panel, showing only the alias for each account.

Passwords are not stored by this plugin.
